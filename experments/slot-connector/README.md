# Slot Connector Experiment

Design and test a basic slot connector for use in future multi-part constructions

## Criteria

Should ideally function well at draft (0.2 mm) layer heights, and include design for both male/female ends of the connector

## Versions

- M/F 0.1.0
  - 0.05 mm gap. Did not slot
- M/F 0.1.1
  - Shortened test models to preserve material and reduce print time
  - 0.1 mm gap. Did not slot
- F 0.1.2
  - 0.2 mm gap. Did not slot
- F 0.1.3
  - 0.4 mm gap. Slotted, slop side-to-side
- F 0.1.4
  - Reduce ONLY side-to-side to 0.2 mm gap. Fits very snugly, slight gap along top.
- M 0.1.4, F 0.1.7
  - Add edge fillets and tighten gap. Tong separation is too low, doesn't slot
- 0.1.8 (Standardize Versions)
  - Increase tong separation, reduce to height of 8 mm for increased time/material efficiency in tests. Tongs too thick
- 0.1.9
  - Narrow tongs. Almost correct, slightly more narrowing may solve the issue
